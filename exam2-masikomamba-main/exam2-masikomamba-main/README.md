# Exam 2 Spring 2023: Custom Queue Based on Age and FIFO

Fill missing code in `AgeQueue.java` such that it enables `addPerson()`, `removePerson()`, and `isEmpty()`, representing a collection of `Person` class objects.

As the name suggests, `AgeQueue` should _prioritize_ Person objects based on higher age in years (not on order of insertion). However, Person objects with the same age should be treated as first in first out. Read the JUnit tests to understand the example cases.

Submit `AgeQueue.java` on zyBooks for grading.
